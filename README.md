# Overview

This is a rework of [this plugin](https://github.com/Monkeypac/tm-twitch-map-command).
The idea is to get something more polished and more documented.

This allows voting for a map from both the In-Game chat and a Twitch chat.

# Install

## From github

Go to [the github repository](https://github.com/Monkeypac/tm-plugin-map-karma) and download the archive. You can then just decompress it in your OpenplanetNext/Plugins folder.

# Usage

Install the plugin, then in the Openplanet menu, click on Scripts > Streaming > Game interface > Show bar.

## Settings

Settings for this plugin can be found in the Openplanet menu under Openplanet > Settings > MapKarma.

From there, you can click on Bar > Move karma windows to resize and reposition the different displays. Untoggle this when you're happy with the positioning.

You can also change the colors and various things from this menu.

## Twitch

To connect to your Twitch chat, you'll need to have the `Twitch Base` plugin installed. 

1. From in game in Plugin manager > Open manager > Search `Twitch Base` > Click `Info` > Click `Install`.
2. Go to Openplanet > Settings > Twitch Base and fill in the information. You can check the plugin information on how to fill those from the [website](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/twitchbase) or directly from the game plugin manager.
3. Reload the MapKarma plugin (Developer > (Re)Load plugin > MapKarma).
